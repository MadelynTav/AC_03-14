Roman numeral calculator
==

In this project, we are going to build a simple calculator with a twist-- a 
calculator that calculates on Roman numerals!


Roman numerals
--

Roman numerals use the following symbols to express numbers.

  Symbol | Value
  :------|-----:
  M      |  1000
  D      |   500
  C      |   100
  L      |    50
  X      |    10
  V      |     5
  I      |     1

Symbols must appear from highest value to lowest value.
In addition, these special combinations are used:

  :------|-----:|:------------------
  CM     |  900 | (instead of DCCCC)
  CD     |  400 | (instead of CCCC)
  XC     |   90 | (instead of LXXXX)
  XL     |   40 | (instead of XXXX)
  IX     |    9 | (instead of VIIII)
  IV     |    4 | (instead of IIII)

No symbol should ever appear more than three times in a row.  There is exactly
one correct way of writing every number between 1 and 3999.

For example, 25 is XXV, 95 is XCV, 99 is XCIX, and 642 is DCXLII.


The repository
--

**FIXME** 

Each team will solve this problem separately.  Start by forking this repository:

    http://github.com/accesscode-2-1/Roman numerals

Each team member should clone the _forked_ repository and work there.  Open the
project in IntelliJ.  There's already some code written:


The team
--

Each team should elect the _team lead_, who is responsible for,

* Creating and managing the git repository.

* Reviewing all code.

* Making sure all code works correctly together.

Each team should split into three groups.  The team lead is in group 3.

**Group 1**

The first group will write the code that formats a number as Roman numerals.

2. The second group will write the code that parses a number in Roman numerals.

3. The first group will write the calculator itself, and code to verify that
the formatting and parsing code work correctly.
